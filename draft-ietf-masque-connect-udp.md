--- abstract

This document describes the CONNECT-UDP HTTP method. CONNECT-UDP is similar
to the HTTP CONNECT method, but it uses UDP instead of TCP.

Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the MASQUE IETF mailing
list [](masque@ietf.org) or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft:

# Introduction {#introduction}

This document describes the CONNECT-UDP HTTP method. CONNECT-UDP is similar
to the HTTP CONNECT method (see section 4.3.6 of {{!RFC7231}}), but it
uses UDP {{!UDP=RFC0768}} instead of TCP {{!TCP=RFC0793}}.


Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the MASQUE IETF mailing
list [](masque@ietf.org) or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft:
[](https://github.com/ietf-wg-masque/draft-ietf-masque-connect-udp).


## Conventions and Definitions {#conventions}

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.


# Supported HTTP Versions {#http-versions}

The CONNECT-UDP method is defined for all versions of HTTP. When the HTTP
version used runs over QUIC {{!QUIC=I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}, UDP payloads
can be sent over QUIC DATAGRAM frames {{!DGRAM=I-D.ietf-quic-datagram}}.
Otherwise they are sent on the stream where the CONNECT-UDP request was made.
Note that when multiple proxies are involved in a CONNECT-UDP request, all
the HTTP connections along the path need to be using
HTTP/3 {{!H3=I-D.ietf-quic-http}} or later in order for UDP payloads to be
sent over QUIC DATAGRAM frames. Additionally, when the HTTP version in use
does not support multiplexing streams (such as HTTP/1.1), then any reference
to "stream" in this document is meant to represent the entire connection.


# The CONNECT-UDP Method {#connect-udp-method}

The CONNECT-UDP method requests that the recipient establish a tunnel over a
single HTTP stream to the destination origin server identified by the
request-target and, if successful, thereafter restrict its behavior to blind
forwarding of packets, in both directions, until the tunnel is closed.
Tunnels are commonly used to create an end-to-end virtual connection, through
one or more proxies, which can then be secured using QUIC or another protocol
running over UDP.

A client sending a CONNECT-UDP request MUST send the authority form of
request-target (Section 5.3 of {{!RFC7230}}); i.e., the request-target
consists of only the host name and port number of the tunnel
destination, separated by a colon. For example,

~~~
     CONNECT-UDP server.example.com:443 HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com:443
~~~

When using HTTP/2 {{!H2=RFC7540}} or later, CONNECT-UDP requests use HTTP
pseudo-headers with the following requirements:

* The ":method" pseudo-header field is set to "CONNECT-UDP".

* The ":scheme" and ":path" pseudo-header fields MUST be omitted.

* The ":authority" pseudo-header field contains the host and port to connect
to (equivalent to the authority-form of the request-target of CONNECT-UDP
requests (see {{!RFC7230}}, Section 5.3)).

A CONNECT-UDP request that does not conform to these restrictions is
malformed (see {{H2}}, Section 8.1.2.6).

The recipient proxy can establish a tunnel either by directly opening a UDP
socket to the request-target or, if configured to use another proxy, by
forwarding the CONNECT-UDP request to the next inbound proxy.
Any 2xx (Successful) response indicates that the sender (and all inbound
proxies) will switch to tunnel mode immediately after the
blank line that concludes the successful response's header section;
data received after that blank line is from the server identified by
the request-target. Any response other than a successful response
indicates that the tunnel has not yet been formed and that the
connection remains governed by HTTP.

A tunnel is closed when a tunnel intermediary detects that either
side has closed its connection: the intermediary MUST attempt to send
any outstanding data that came from the closed side to the other
side, close both connections, and then discard any remaining data
left undelivered.

A server MUST NOT send any Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header fields
in a 2xx (Successful) response to CONNECT. A client MUST treat a response
to CONNECT-UDP containing any Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header
fields as malformed.

A payload within a CONNECT-UDP request message has no defined semantics;
a CONNECT-UDP request with a non-empty payload is malformed.

Responses to the CONNECT-UDP method are not cacheable.

# Encoding of Proxied UDP Packets {#encoding}

When the HTTP connection between client and proxy supports HTTP/3 datagrams
{{!H3DGRAM=I-D.schinazi-quic-h3-datagram}}, UDP packets can be encoded using
QUIC DATAGRAM frames. This support is ascertained by checking receipt of the
H3_DATAGRAM SETTINGS Parameter. Note that when there are multiple proxies
involved, this support needs to be ascertained on all the HTTP connections
that will carry proxied UDP packets.

If the client supports HTTP/3 datagrams and has received the H3_DATAGRAM
SETTINGS Parameter on this connection, it SHOULD attempt to use HTTP/3
datagrams. This is accomplished by requesting a datagram flow identifier
from the flow identifier allocation service {{H3DGRAM}}. That service
generates an even flow identifier, and the client sends it to the server
by using the "Datagram-Flow-Id" header (see {{header}}).

If there are multiple proxies involved, proxies along the chain MUST check
whether their upstream connection supports HTTP/3 datagrams. If it does not,
that proxy MUST remove the "Datagram-Flow-Id" header before forwarding the
CONNECT-UDP request.

The proxy that is creating the UDP socket to the destination responds to the
CONNECT-UDP request with a 2xx (Successful) response, and MUST echo the
"Datagram-Flow-Id" header. Once the client has received the "Datagram-Flow-Id"
header on the successful response, it knows that it can use the HTTP/3
datagram encoding to send proxied UDP packets for this particular destination.
It then encodes the payload of UDP datagrams into the payload of HTTP/3
datagrams.

Clients MAY optimistically start sending proxied UDP packets before receiving
the response to its CONNECT-UDP request, noting however that those may not be
processed by the proxy if it responds to the CONNECT-UDP request with a
failure, or if they arrive before the CONNECT-UDP request.

If HTTP/3 datagrams are not supported, the stream is used to convey UDP
payloads, by prefixing them with a 16-bit length.

# Datagram-Flow-Id Header Definition {#header}

"Datagram-Flow-Id" is a Item Structured
Header {{!STRUCT-HDR=I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}. Its value MUST be an
Integer. Its ABNF is:

~~~
  Datagram-Flow-Id = sh-integer
~~~

# Server Handling {#server-handling}

Unlike TCP, UDP is connection-less. The HTTP server that opens the UDP socket
has no way of knowing whether the destination is reachable. Therefore it needs
to respond to the CONNECT-UDP request without waiting for a TCP SYN-ACK.

Servers can use connected UDP sockets if their operating system supports them,
as that allows the HTTP server to rely on the kernel to only send it UDP
packets that match the correct 5-tuple. If the server uses a non-connected
socket, it MUST validate the IP source address and UDP source port on received
packets to ensure they match the client's CONNECT-UDP request. Packets that do
not match MUST be discarded by the server.


# Security Considerations {#security}

There are significant risks in allowing arbitrary clients to establish a
tunnel to arbitrary servers, as that could allow bad actors to send traffic
and have it attributed to the proxy. Proxies that support CONNECT-UDP SHOULD
restrict its use to authenticated users.


# IANA Considerations {#iana}

## HTTP Method {#iana-method}

This document will request IANA to register "CONNECT-UDP" in the
HTTP Method Registry (IETF review) maintained at
<[](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods)>.

~~~
  +-------------+------+------------+---------------+
  | Method Name | Safe | Idempotent |   Reference   |
  +-------------+------+------------+---------------+
  | CONNECT-UDP |  no  |     no     | This document |
  +-------------+------+------------+---------------+
~~~

## HTTP Header {#iana-header}

This document will request IANA to register the "Datagram-Flow-Id"
header in the "Permanent Message Header Field Names"
registry maintained at
<[](https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers)>.

~~~
  +-------------------+----------+--------+---------------+
  | Header Field Name | Protocol | Status |   Reference   |
